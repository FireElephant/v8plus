# v8plus Change History

## 1.0.0

This is the first major release of *v8plus*.  Throughout its development
history, *v8plus* has sought to remain backwards compatible.  In particular, if
you are already using a 0.3.X version, the upgrade to 1.0.0 should be smooth.

This release is the first to support Node 0.12.X and Node 4.X.  This, and
subsequent versions will follow the usual semver rules with respect to
interface changes and bug fixes.
